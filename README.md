# Advent of Code 2015

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

I did most of these exercises back in 2015 in Python. However,
I don't find those solutions :(

So in Nov, 2025 I decided to solve them again. This time, I try to
do it in a new language, [**D**](https://dlang.org/).

Python will be a fallback solution.
